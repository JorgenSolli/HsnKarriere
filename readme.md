# HSN Karriere

HSN Karriere is a web-app with the goal of making it easier for students to find internships. This is done by letting various companies register and advertise their company. Both students and companies can be the initializer of a internship. 

Proffessors will be encouraged to register and will be able to approve internships for the students they have responsibility for. This allows us to reduce the amount of effort and work it requires to initialize and maintan a internship by a huge margin. Paperwork and oganization will be less for both the students, proffessors and comapnies.
